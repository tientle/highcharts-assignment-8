<p class="story"> Walking across a stage in a cap and gown to receive a diploma representing years of hard work is a key milestone in most students’ lives. Graduating from high school is one of the greatest tools for social and financial mobility, yet Florida’s graduation rate in 4-year public high schools still lags behind the national average. For those who are low-income or first-generation, a high school diploma is life changing. For example, in 2009, the average income for a high school graduate was $27,380 compared to a high school dropout’s annual income of $19,540.<sup>1</sup> There are also disparities among different races and demographics: students with disabilities had the lowest graduation rate at 52.3% and Asian/Pacific Islander students graduated at a rate of 88.4%. A study done by the Urban Institute found that students in historically disadvantaged groups, including American Indian, Hispanic and Black students, statistically have a 50-50 chance of graduating high school.<sup>2</sup> Ultimately, increasing the overall graduation rate to at least equal the national average and increasing graduation rates within certain races and demographics will require a statewide effort to identify key drop-out factors and making sure that vulnerable demographics have the appropriate support available in order to graduate.</p>
